# OpenBiologist 🧬

> **PuchAI Hackathon Project** - An MCP-powered WhatsApp bot for accessible biological research and discovery.

## 🌟 About

OpenBiologist is an innovative MCP (Model Context Protocol) application that brings biological research tools directly to WhatsApp. Built for the PuchAI hackathon, this project democratizes access to biological research by allowing users to query databases, analyze sequences, and collaborate on research projects through simple WhatsApp messages.

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:jaywyawhare/OpenBiologist.git
   cd OpenBiologist
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. **Start the MCP server**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
